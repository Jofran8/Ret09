                  The James Webb Space Telescope is a space observatory developed through the collaboration of twenty countries, built and operated jointly by NASA, the European Space Agency and the Canadian SpaceAgency, to replace the Hubble and Spitzer telescopes. JWST's scientific mission has four main goals: to find light from the first stars and galaxies that formed in the universe after the Big Bang; study the formation and evolution of galaxies; understand the formation of stars and solar systems; and study planetary systems and the origins of life.
